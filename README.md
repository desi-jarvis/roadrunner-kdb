Welcome to **roadrunner-kdb,An Offensive Security Knowledge Database**, 

This is a guide to offensive security operations where we have stored necessary information, tools, and techniques to help you succeed in your offensive security operations and operate at maximum efficiency. 

In addition to wide range of topics and information, our knowledge database includes a variety of checklists, cheat sheets, and quick reference guides that you can use as a map during your operations. These resources are designed to help you stay organized and focused during your operations.

There are no definitive runbooks for simulating advanced adversaries. A lot of this is about situational awareness and orienting yourself to the environment, systems and/or applications you are targeting as well as the ones you have already compromised.  

The last thing operators needs to worry about is trying to re-learn tools and techniques they used some time ago. This database is designed to alleviate some of that pain.
